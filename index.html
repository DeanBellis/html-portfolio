    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
     <p>I would regard myself as a patient, polite and determined individual, who is capable of communicating respectfully and diligently with both Managerial staff and colleagues alike. I am comfortable working on my own initiative, under supervision and instruction, and whilst also part of a wider team. I am responsible, reliable, punctual and capable of adhering to set schedules of work as they are presented, and I regularly work beyond that which is normally expected in order to complete any task or assignment that may be set to hand. I am someone you can count on to go above and beyond to get the job done.
